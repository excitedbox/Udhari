## Udhari  ##

Decentralized app with no data being pushed to Google or any cloud. It is completely private and only meant for Self realization of expenses you make in cash or account transaction.

### Why ###
All small shops maintain credit register or they remember by memory. If we can capture credit or money flow.

### Challenge ###
Major problem is transaction repudiation if either party denies transaction did happened.

#### Privacy ####
Based on this simple idea of capturing money flow data not synced with cloud or any other service. Instead only between two parties . Similar to WhatsApp users can do backup on Google drive in encrypted format.

### Constraints ###
It has to be faster than writing in register.
Should not rely on internet but peer to peer networking over Bluetooth.

## UX Design ##
Below decribes most of the screens to be designed for Project
### Main Screen ###
Similar to gmail with all transactions being displayed in simple list. Latest transaction should be displayed on top and older at lower order. they can be both debit and credit at same time.
